    <p> The sport of Hockey has evolved from an early sport that used a stick and ball that rose in Scotland called Shinty or Chamaire, which was played in the early 17th century. It was played for fun on metal skates using the ice that formed in the harsh Scottish winters. This sport soon became popular in Ireland aswell. Along with that, at the time, there were many Irish people that immigrated to Canada. This caused the new and evolved game of Hurling, or Hurley to be spread to Canada. This sport of Hurley quickly evolved into the sport we now know today as Hockey.</p>

    <p>Hockey is a fun game with many rules. One major rule is the offsides rule. On a sheet of standard ice, there are two blue lines, a red line, two goal lines, and faceoff circles on the left and right side of the zones, in the corner of the neutral zone, and a large one at center ice. Offsides occurs when a player travels over the opposing teams blue line before the puck does, which can be carried or not. Though it depends on the league you play in, offsides can either occur when the puck crossed the blue line while you are offsides, or when somebody that is offsides touches the puck. Another rule that occurs in other sports are the penalties. There are many different types of penalties, such as tripping, hooking, slashing, etc. The most common penalty is tripping. A tripping is when a player causes annother player to fall or lose balance by taking out their feet with either their stick or body. One last rule that is more important than it seems is changing. Changing lines is a part of the game. SImilar to sports like lacrosse, you can change either during the play or furing a whistle. Players change very often, about every 1-2 minutes, so changing is extremely important. Players when not in play will sit on the bench until they are changed in.</p>
